# How did the homework go for you this week?

Please rate how homework went for you this week with a number from 1-5. These are not points in a grade, but rather numbers that represent statements about how well things went (see corresponding statements below). Clarissa or another TA will ask you about this on Mondays. If you are not done on Monday, you will be asked again later. You can even change your number if you go back to the homework and revise your answers or finish more of the problems. Revisiting the homework is highly encouraged. There is no official "late" status for homework. Do realize, however, if you get far enough beind, it will become very difficult to catch up. 

1. I don't get this homework at all. I feel totally lost. I never really got close to a solution for any of the problems. 
2. I am really struggling. I solved one or two of the homework problems, but I am totally lost on the others. 
3. I feel like I am understanding the new material. I was successful on more than half of the homework problems. I do still have some major concepts that I need to review and figure out. 
4. I really excelled at the homework this week, but I did not completely solve the trickiest problems. I understand nearly all of the ideas related to the homework. I have some minor concepts to figure out. 
5. I got every homework problem correct before looking at the answer key (identical results, not necessarily identical code). I am really understanding the material and am ready for more difficult challenges.
