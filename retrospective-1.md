### Walk around the block, up to 2x and come up with the following: 

1. General Feedback: Come up with one of each (Red, Green, Yellow Light) that you all agree on:  
    Red Light -- What is something in the class you wish would STOP
    Green Light -- What is something in the class that you wish would CONTINUE
    Yellow Light -- Choice: either something that isn't happening that you wish WAS happening, or something that is happening that you are confused about
    
2. How much total study time have you been putting in outside of class(not just homework)?  Average this number of hours for your group. Come to a consensus about whether this is enough time for you to succeed in the course. 

3. What has proved to be the most effective way to get through the homework sucessfully? 

4. Come to a consensus about whether the homework is too much, too little, or the perfect amount. 

Record the Answers for your group on a piece of paper
